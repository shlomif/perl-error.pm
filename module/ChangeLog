  Errno.pm

Oct 28 1997 <gbarr@pobox.com>

  Error.pm #0.12

  - Removed proceed clause

Oct 27 1997 <gbarr@pobox.com>

  Error.pm #0.11

  - Fixed calling of otherwise clause if there are no catch claues

Oct 21 1997 <gbarr@pobox.com>

  Error.pm #0.10

  - Added proceed clause, the return value from the proceed block
    will be returned by throw.
  - try will now return the result from the try block
    or from the catch
  - Changed except clause handling so that block is only evaluated
    once, the first time the result is required.
  - Changed catch and proceed blocks to accept two arguments. The
    second argument is a reference to a scalar, which if set to true
    will cause Error to continue looking for a catch/proceed block
    when the block returns.

Oct 19 1997 <gbarr@pobox.com>

  - Added associate method so that an existing error may be associated
    with an object.

Oct 10 1997 <gbarr@pobox.com>
